`gitty` is a smart little CLI helper for git projects, that shows you all the
relevant issues, pull requests and changes at a quick glance, right on the
command-line. It currently supports the GitHub, GitLab, and Gitea APIs.

Compiling gitty is easy, simply run:

    git clone https://github.com/muesli/gitty.git
    cd gitty
    go build

## Access Tokens

Note: In order to access the APIs of hosting providers like GitHub, GitLab, or
Gitea, `gitty` requires you to provide valid access tokens in an environment
variable called `GITTY_TOKENS`.

You can provide tokens for multiple hosts and services in this format:

`github.com=abc123;gitlab.com=xyz890;myhost.tld=...`

### GitHub

You can [create a new token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo:status,public_repo,read:user,read:org&description=gitty)
in your profile settings:
Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Generate new token

Make sure to enable the `repo:status`, `public_repo`, `read:user`, and
`read:org` permissions in particular.

### GitLab

You can create a new token in your profile settings:
User Settings > Access Tokens

Make sure to enable the `read_user`, `read_api`, and `read_repository`
permissions.

### Gitea

You can create a new token in your profile settings:
Settings > Applications > Manage Access Tokens

## Usage

You can start `gitty` with either a path or a URL as an argument. If no argument
was provided, `gitty` will operate on the current working directory.

```bash
$ gitty /some/repo
$ gitty github.com/some/project
$ gitty https://myhost.tld/some/project
```

The following flags are supported:

```
  -max-branch-age int
        Max age of a branch in days to be considered active (default 28)
  -max-branches int
        Max amount of active branches to show (default 10)
  -max-commits int
        Max amount of commits to show (default 10)
  -max-issues int
        Max amount of issues to show (default 10)
  -max-pull-requests int
        Max amount of pull requests to show (default 10)
```

### Open issue or pull request in browser

If you launch `gitty` with the ID of an issue or pull request, it will open the
issue or pull request in your browser:

```bash
$ gitty [PATH|URL] 42
```

### Monitoring entire namespaces

gitty also lets you monitor entire namespaces, giving you an overview of all its
repositories:

```bash
$ gitty --all-projects github.com
```

Per default it will show the projects of the token owner, but you can also
retrieve the projects of other namespaces:

```bash
$ gitty --all-projects --namespace muesli github.com
```
